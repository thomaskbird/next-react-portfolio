They came to us with a need for not just a website, but a website that could help alleviate their workload and consolidate requests.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time the company had been going between 5-10 data sources, manually searching and copying and pasting data on over 100 requests per day. What we did was create an automated online software system that allowed them to handle all of that in one place. In addition, we gave title companies and notary\u2019s the ability to edit their own profile information, upload forms, submit job tickets, etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also employed an automated emailing system and automated job tasks that run daily. The email system helps keep every involved on each job up to date with realtime information. For instance, any time a job ticket is updated the notary, administrators and title company involved are notified. This is important in case the closing location were to change the notary was able to stay aware. The automated job tasks allowed notary\u2019s and title companies the ability to select how often they wanted to receive their job report which contained vital details like how much they were getting paid, if they had been paid etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help allow the site to work on its own we created a notary application process, this took everything out of the administrators hands and allowed notary\u2019s the ability to submit an application to the administrators. Once the administrator approved the application an activation email got sent to the notarys allowing them the ability to then activate their account, login and begin receiving jobs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the notary\u2019s side and admin we integrated Google maps allowing notarys the ability to quickly and easily get accurate maps and directions to the closing locations. On the administration side we created maps that took a notary feed and feed a Google map which allowed administrators the ability to see how far notarys actually were from the closing location.<\/p>","keywords":"Mortgage closings inc, notary, signings, frontend, design, php","order":"0.00","status":"published","type":"post","created_at":"2017-03-14 06:12:25","updated_at":"2017-03-17 16:32:14","deleted_at":null}, {"id":"4","author_id":"0","parent_id":"0","version_of":"0","title":"Thomas L Imbrunone","nav_text":"Thomas L Imbrunone","slug":"thomas-l-imbrunone","description":"When Thomas L Imbrunone approached us he had never had a website before, our goal was to create an SEO optimized site with a focus on delivering his content on a wide range of devices and not just desktops.

This explains how to correct that and get a nice clean preview the way you would expect when you render the final footage.<\/p>\r\n<p>So it's really quite easy to accomplish this, although a bit time consuming when you have a large amount of footage and large format like 4k or the like. Simply open up Adobe Premiere, you can basically go to wherever you have your timeline. The key is to find the beginning and end of what you want to preview or if you'd prefer you can render the entire clip however this takes much more time so I recommend rendering just what you're working on.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you've found the start of what you want to see press `i` for `in` and then scrub to the end of what you want to see and press `o` for `out`. This essentially sets a starting point and endpoint for what you want to preview. After you've selected your desired footage you can go up to the main nav and click on `Sequence`, which drops down a list of item select `Render In to Out`. Give it a few minutes maybe more if your rendering a large amount of footage, but once it's finished rendering you should be able to smoothly preview your footage in Adobe Premiere.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once your finished to clear your selection simply go to your timeline over where you set your `in` and `out` and right click selecting `Clear In and Out`.<\/p>","keywords":"video, edit, editing, adobe, premiere, rendering, preview issues, jitter, lag","order":"0.00","status":"published","type":"post","created_at":"2017-11-03 09:29:26","updated_at":"2017-11-03 09:29:26","deleted_at":null}, {"id":"87","author_id":"0","parent_id":"0","version_of":"58","title":"BootstrapGenerator","nav_text":"BootstrapGenerator","slug":"bootstrapgenerator","description":"<p>A while ago I got tired of having multiple Twitter Bootstrap modal windows show up in my code and thought it would be nice to have a javascript plugin that could be fed some content generate its own modal.

The problem is that because I used classes to determine the layout of the markup my content was now having two job descriptions on top of each other and two images right on top of each other giving me an awkward and usual feel to the layout. Below is an example of what the layout appeared:<\/p>\r\n<p>In a single column scenario it looked peculiar and out of place. I'd worked with the new flex capabilities some time ago and knew that I could manipulate the order of the layout based on css. Coupling this with media queries and I could essentially changed the order of the content instead of having to use css classes and php to alternate those classes.

Below is an example of what the markup looked like to give context.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">\r\n&lt;?php foreach($jobs as $i =&gt; $job) { ?&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;?php if($i % 2 === 0) { ?&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;div class=\"col-sm-9\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;p&gt;Job description and experience here...&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=\"col-sm-3\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;img class=\"company-logo\" \/&gt;\r\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n        \r\n    &lt;?php } else {?&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;div class=\"col-sm-3\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;img class=\"company-logo\" \/&gt;\r\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=\"col-sm-9\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;p&gt;Job description and experience here...&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;?php } ?&gt;\r\n&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n&lt;?php } ?&gt;\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>This generated something like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">\r\n&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;div class=\"col-sm-3\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;img class=\"company-logo\" \/&gt;\r\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=\"col-sm-9\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Job description and experience here...&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=\"col-sm-9\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Job description and experience here...&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=\"col-sm-3\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;img class=\"company-logo\" \/&gt;\r\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n    \r\n&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;div class=\"col-sm-3\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;img class=\"company-logo\" \/&gt;\r\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=\"col-sm-9\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Job description and experience here...&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=\"col-sm-9\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Job description and experience here...&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=\"col-sm-3\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;img class=\"company-logo\" \/&gt;\r\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n    \r\n&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The above gives us a layout similar to this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"..\/media\/original-markup-pic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"804\" height=\"907\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Now this isn't to bad when it comes to desktop and also tablet, where I had the problem is when I got into smaller device screens like phones. The problem is that because I used classes to determine the layout of the markup my content was now having two job descriptions on top of each other and two images right on top of each other giving me an awkward and usual feel to the layout. Below is an example of what the layout appeared:<\/p>\r\n<p>In a single column scenario it looked peculiar and out of place. I'd worked with the new flex capabilities some time ago and knew that I could manipulate the order of the layout based on css. Coupling this with media queries and I could essentially changed the order of the content instead of having to use css classes and php to alternate those classes. So I before taking this straight into my website and starting the development, I decided to make a quick proof of concept.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>I first started by writing some simple markup to give the prototype an actual of a real website.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">\r\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt;Flex Testing&lt;\/title&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;style&gt;\r\n    \/* base styles *\/\r\n        body {\r\n            font-family: 'helvetica', verdana, tahoma;\r\n            font-weight: 100;\r\n            line-height: 140%;\r\n            font-size: 14px;\r\n            color: #666;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        h1,h2,h3,h4,h5 {\r\n            font-weight: 500;\r\n            border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;\r\n            padding-bottom: 10px;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        .container {\r\n            width: 1140px;\r\n            margin: 0 auto;\r\n            display: flex;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        .content-main, .sidebar {\r\n            padding: 15px;\r\n            box-sizing: border-box;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        .content-main {\r\n            width: 70%;\r\n            order: 1;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        .sidebar {\r\n            width: 30%;\r\n            order: 2;\r\n        }\r\n    &lt;\/style&gt;\r\n&lt;\/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=\"content-main\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=\"job-row\"&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=\"job-image\"&gt;\r\n                    &lt;div class=\"job-logo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n                &lt;\/div&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=\"job-information\"&gt;\r\n                    &lt;h3&gt;lorem Ipsum&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\n                    &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
